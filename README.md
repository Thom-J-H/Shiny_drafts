## Second Assignment
This was done for [Collin Paschall's course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-viz-shiny-dashboards/home/welcome) at Coursera. I jazzed up the original a decent bit. It requires the [cces_smaple_coursera.csv](https://github.com/Thom-J-H/Shiny_drafts/blob/main/cces_sample_coursera.csv) file, and the R libraries <code>shiny</code>, <code>shinythemes</code>, <code>tidyverse</code>, <code>glue</code>, <code>plotly</code>, and <code>DT</code>.  If not yet archived, the link to the [working app](https://thomasjhaslam.shinyapps.io/Second_Shiny/).
