## Second Assignment
This was done for [Collin Paschall's course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-viz-shiny-dashboards/home/welcome) at Coursera. I jazzed up the original a decent bit. It requires the [cces_smaple_coursera.csv](https://github.com/Thom-J-H/Shiny_drafts/blob/main/cces_sample_coursera.csv) file, and the R libraries <code>shiny</code>, <code>shinythemes</code>, <code>tidyverse</code>, <code>glue</code>, <code>plotly</code>, and <code>DT</code>.  If not yet archived, the link to the [working app](https://thomasjhaslam.shinyapps.io/Second_Shiny/).

## A Hot Mess: Gapminder Compare & Contrast
My first real effort at a Shiny app from June 2020. It ran beautifully locally, and painfully slow on the server. So: FAIL. Developed this for a writing class I was teaching. It will eventually get a thorough edit and debugging: just a hot mess of HTML and R beneath the hood. Requires the [gapminder.RData](https://github.com/Thom-J-H/Shiny_drafts/blob/main/gapminder.RData) file, and (for now) the R libraries <code>shiny</code>, <code>shinythemes</code>, <code>tidyverse</code>, <code>leaflet</code>, <code>plotly</code>, and <code>DT</code>.
